## Some small info about me
I'm from Indonesia. I started my enjoyable journey with Android and Linux in 2019. Since then, I've become interested in Open Source projects like **Linux Kernel**. I've been developing **Linux Kernel** for several Android devices since then. It's been a fun journey. I hope it continues.

## What am I up to now?
- Contributing to Open Source projects (sometimes).
- Roaming around GitHub without a clear purpose.

I'm currently publicly reachable only on [Telegram](https://t.me/fdlyas07), preferably in Bahasa but English is also okay.
