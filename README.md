## About me
I’m from Indonesia 🇮🇩. Right now, I’m pursuing my degree in Communication Science 🎓 while also having fun exploring the world of Android, Linux, and Open Source.

My journey started back in 2019, when I began tinkering with Linux Kernel for Android devices. Since then, I’ve been hooked—debugging, experimenting, and sharing knowledge with the community.

At the same time, my studies in communication have sharpened how I see the world: not just building things, but also learning how to share ideas, connect with people, and tell stories in a meaningful way.

## What I’m up to these days
- Occasionally contributing to Open Source projects.
- Wandering around GitHub, exploring random repos.
- Always learning something new.
