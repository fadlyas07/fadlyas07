## Some minor info about myself
I am from Indonesia. I started my journey with Linux in 2019. Since then, I've been very interested in Linux Kernel. I've been developing linux kernels for my Android device since then. It's been a fun journey. Hope it continues.

## What are you upto now?
- Recognize this world.
- Contributing to opensource projects sometimes.
- Wandering around GitHub mindlessly.
